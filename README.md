# Quant Research Lab

A repository for replicating, validating, and experimenting with quantitative finance research papers.  
This lab serves as a sandbox to test academic strategies in practice — from momentum and reversal strategies to multi-factor models.

---

## Objectives
- Replicate and validate results from academic papers in quantitative finance.  
- Backtest strategies on historical data to assess robustness.  
- Compare academic findings with practical implementation (transaction costs, drawdowns, Sharpe ratios, etc.).  
- Provide reusable code templates for portfolio analysis and performance evaluation.
