# Quant Research Lab ðŸ§ªðŸ“Š

A repository for replicating, validating, and experimenting with quantitative finance research papers.  
This lab serves as a sandbox to test academic strategies in practice â€” from momentum and reversal strategies to multi-factor models.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Replicate and validate results from academic papers in quantitative finance.
